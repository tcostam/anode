# ANode - Distributed event-based Arduino framework.

In progress.

This Arduino library aims to provide an easy framework to:

- Connect to a wireless network
- Receive, generate and send events through the
network
- Treat events received through the network.

Setup:

- Create a central controlling Arduino node to act as a
gateway for all events generated by the connected nodes.

- Create arduino controlled nodes to communicate to
each other through events, sent to the central node gateway.

Characteristics:

- ANode is a framework that enables the creation of services
that communicate on an event-based environment.

- It facilitates the bootstrap of custom nodes, abstracting
the communication layer.

- ANode uses a custom protocol, built over TCP, to optimize
the transmission of events data.

Currently only supports ESP8266-01 wi-fi microcontroller
connected to a HardwareSerial port.
